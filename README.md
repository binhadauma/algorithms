Algorithms 

This repository contains the algorithms for my class in Programming I. Most parts of the work were made in VisualG and the exercises were taken in the online course of Teacher Guanabara. You can see the materials on his site (https://www.cursoemvideo.com/).

The exercises exemplifying several structures in computing algorithms: conditional, functions, vectors, and matrices. Some algorithms were developed using Scratch, this is a funny way for me to learn code and you can see the results playing with me.
